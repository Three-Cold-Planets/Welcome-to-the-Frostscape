## Overview
Welcome to the Frostscape is an indev v7 campaign-based mod which focuses on unit control, stealth and various new systems. This is my in the Three Cold Planets colab. The mod takes place on Hollus and its three moons. Development is being lead by [@Sh1penfire](https://github.com/Sh1penfire) along with [@ThatOneCreator](https://github.com/shadow5927), [@RilyProductions](https://github.com/RilyProductions) & [@RandomUser](https://github.com/RandomUserRU). It is currently in it's wip stage and is being used as a progress dump for Hollus's content.

Main test mod for Hollus as part of https://github.com/Three-Cold-Planets, check out our other projects/the main mod. Thank you :D

## Current Goal
Currently the next milestone in development that im aiming to hit is finishing the MVP. I don't have an estamated time of completion for it, but join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/XrFhAZys7T), or check the [trello](https://trello.com/b/2g9oENth/hollow-frostscape) to keep up with development!

## Dependancies/Compatabilities

As of current, Frostscape doesn't have any dependancies/compatabilities, but it does however have a few planned ones
Block Selection/Block Scanning will be implemented in a separate mod, and will have Frostscape-specific features stripped. When enablling either mod with Frostscape, they will be disabled.

If any mod maker wants to make their own environmental tiles compatable with Frostscape's block scanning mechanic, send them [this](https://github.com/Sh1penfire/Welcome-to-the-Frostscape/blob/master/guides/Environmental%20Scanning%20Entries.md) page
